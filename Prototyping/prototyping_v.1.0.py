    Jarvis - A data-collecting chatbot for Slack

    All prototyping/testing code for Jarvis should go in this file
    before implementing into the main jarvis.py codebase. This file is
    just to help us test out certain things before jumping right in to 
    development.

    Keep this file in the master branch as is without any edits. Create
    a separate branch to overwrite this file with personal prototyping.
