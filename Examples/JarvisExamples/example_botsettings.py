"""
    This is just here as an example of the botsettings.py file that we will
    have on our computers. We don't want to upload this file to the repo
    because it will contain the tokens which are used to allow Jarvis to
    log in/connect to our workspace. Theoretically, if we uploaded the tokens
    to the repo, then evil mysterious hackerZ could use it to log in to our
    Slack repo and pursue their evil deeds!

    What we will do instead is have this file be on our own computers with the
    tokens so we can run Jarvis successfully without comprimising the security
    of our Slack repo (and unleashing the wrath of Professor Bagrow to deduct
    points).
